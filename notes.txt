1. Contrast Sets
Definition: Contrast sets are small, hand-constructed datasets where each example in the set is a minimal modification of an original example. These modifications are designed to test whether models can handle slight variations in input.
Purpose: To evaluate whether a model's predictions are consistent and robust when exposed to changes in input that should logically lead to different outputs.
Example: If a model correctly classifies the sentence "The cat is on the mat," a contrast set example might change it to "The cats are on the mats" to check if the model handles plurality properly.
Reference: Gardner et al. (2020) introduced contrast sets to help reveal where models struggle with generalizing small perturbations in their data.
